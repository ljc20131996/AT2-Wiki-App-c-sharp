Array	Array	Linear	A linear array is a one-dimensional array, representing a sequential collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, accessible by an index or a key. It provides a simple and straightforward way to organize and access a list of data elements in a linear fashion.
2D Array	List	Linear	2D array, is a structured collection of elements arranged in rows and columns, providing a grid-like structure. Unlike a traditional linear array, it allows for a two-dimensional indexing scheme, making it suitable for organizing and manipulating data in tabular form.
List	List	Linear	A list is a data structure that organizes elements in a linear order, allowing for sequential storage and retrieval. It can be dynamic in size, enabling the addition or removal of elements as needed.
Linked list	List	Linear	A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion or deletion of elements at any position within the list.
Self-Balance Tree	Tree	Non-Linear	A self-balancing tree, such as an AVL tree or a Red-Black tree, is a binary search tree with additional mechanisms to maintain balance during insertions and deletions. These trees automatically adjust their structure to ensure that the height remains relatively balanced, improving search and retrieval performance.
Heap	Tree	Non-Linear	A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the key of each node is either always greater than or always less than the keys of its children. In computer science, heaps are commonly used for implementing priority queues and heap-sort algorithms.
Binary Search Tree	Tree	Non-Linear	A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, and the key in each node is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree. This structure facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making it a commonly used data structure for organizing and maintaining sorted data.
Graph	Graph	Non-Linear	A graph is a mathematical and data structure representation of a set of objects, where pairs of objects are connected by edges. It consists of vertices (nodes) and edges, which can be directed or undirected, forming a network that models relationships or connections between different entities.
Set	Abstract	Non-Linear	A set is a collection of distinct elements with no specific order, and it is defined by its members. In mathematics and computer science, sets are fundamental data structures used for storing and manipulating unique elements.
Queue	Abstract	Linear	A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to the back (rear) and removed from the front (front) of the queue. It represents a collection of elements with operations like enqueue (addition) and dequeue (removal) performed in a sequential manner.
Stack	Abstract	Linear	A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added or removed from the top of the stack. It represents a collection of elements with two main operations: push (addition) and pop (removal).
Hash Table	Hash	Non-Linear	A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of values. It provides constant-time average complexity for basic operations, such as insertion, deletion, and lookup, making it widely used in various applications for associative arrays or dictionaries.
